There's a bunch of stuff to finish before this can be released as a major version,<br>
But for now this is a stable alpha release ready for testing.

Here's a few things that's ontop of the list before a release is made:

 * Security sanity check on the code
 * Compress the code, remove unesscessary code and functionize blob-code
 * Restructure the code to be more logical
 * Test and verification by a non-developer
