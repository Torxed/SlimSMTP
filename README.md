There's a bunch of stuff to finish before this can be released as a major version,<br>
But for now this is a stable alpha release ready for testing.

Here's a few things that's ontop of the list before a release is made:

 * [Security sanity check on the code](https://github.com/Torxed/SlimSMTP/issues/3)
 * ```Error handling```
 * ```Restructure the code to be more logical```
 * [Test and verification by a non-developer](https://github.com/Torxed/SlimSMTP/issues/5)
